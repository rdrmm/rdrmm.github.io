Reasonably Delightful Remote Monitoring and Management public website

While the concept is as old as computing and options plentiful, none I reviewed were small/simple enough to keep me from getting to you.

rdRMM aims to live off the land, using OS native features for basic functionality and operating without a separate 'agent' binary/installation.

Using standard tooling, protocols, and utilities already present on a machine rdRMM enables asset inventory, remote monitoring, and even remote access.
